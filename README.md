## KendrickMassFilter

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks adapted from [da Silva and collaborators (2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347485/) 
used to filter our data for undesired chemical background of repeat units typical of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) through a Kendrick Mass Filter.

## PCoA_PERMANOVA

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook used to create principal component analysis plots and Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA).
